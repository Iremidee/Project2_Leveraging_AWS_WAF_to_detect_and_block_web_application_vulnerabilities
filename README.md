# Project2_Leveraging_AWS_WAF_to_detect_and_block_web_application_vulnerabilities
## Project Overview
Web applications are increasingly becoming targets for cyberattacks, making the need for stronger security measures paramount. Vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) can exploit weaknesses in web applications, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and financial losses.


Amazon Web Services (AWS) Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a cloud-native service designed to protect web applications from these common vulnerabilities by allowing organisations to create customizable rules to monitor, detect, and block potentially malicious requests. This project aims to explore how AWS WAF can be leveraged to detect and block these threats effectively.
## Scenario
XYZ E-commerce, a growing online marketplace, faced increasing security risks as its user base expanded. Before implementing AWS WAF, the platform was vulnerable to common web-based attacks like SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), putting customer data and service reliability at risk. Without AWS WAF, the platform couldnâ€™t efficiently detect or block malicious traffic, leaving it exposed to potential data breaches, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

After implementing AWS WAF, the platform's security improved significantly. AWS WAF allowed rapid detection and blocking of malicious traffic, protected customer data, and ensured service reliability by mitigating the risk of attacks. This real-time, scalable solution adapted to evolving threats, creating a more secure environment for both the business and its customers.

A key lesson from the 2019 Capital One breach, caused by a misconfigured WAF that allowed SSRF exploitation, underscores the importance of AWS WAF in preventing such vulnerabilities and ensuring robust security as XYZ E-commerce grows.

* Public Subnets
* Private Subnets
* Amazon RDS
* Application Load Balancers
* Internet Gateway
* AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* AWS Web Application Firewall

## Project Objective
To effectively implement AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) as a security solution to detect, prevent, and mitigate common web application vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing the overall security posture and protecting sensitive data of web applications.

METHODS TO ACHIEVE WORK
1. Create a sample web application hosted on AWS to serve as the target for the Project.
2. Configure AWS WAF and setup WAF rules for detecting SQL injection, XSS, and SSRF.
3. Integrate AWS WAF with the web application, load balancer and CloudWatch for real-time threat monitoring.
4. Simulate attacks on the web application to test the effectiveness of the WAF rules.
5. Analyse the logs and reports generated by AWS CloudWatch integrated with eventbridge and WAF to assess how well vulnerabilities were detected and blocked.

## Requirements
